# Latham Laboratory Scripts
Python Scripts used by the [Latham Laboratory (University of Minnesota)](https://www.lathamlaboratory.org/) for analyzing NMR data.

## About
These are the python scripts we use to analyze NMR data and use that data for other applications (i.e., nmrPipe, CCPN analysis, HADDOCK).

## Dependencies
[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)  
[Scipy](https://scipy.org/)  
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/)  
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
[nmrglue](https://github.com/jjhelmus/nmrglue)  

## Running Scripts
All our scripts use the `argparse` python library to parse command line arguments. You can get a brief description for what the script does and the arguments it takes by running `methyl_CSP.py3 -h` or simply `methyl_CSP.py3`.
